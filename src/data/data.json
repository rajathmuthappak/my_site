The solution involves moving of the disks one after the other over the pegs obeying the above specified rules. User interface requires the user to enter the number of disks on the source peg. Using the intermediate peg all  the n disks are moved to the destination peg and the number of moves required are 2n -1.",

                "How to solve this problem?<br> We use recursion to solve this problem,<br> If we assume the number of disks to be three then we follow the below mentioned steps:<br> Step 1:Move disk 1 from source to destination.<br> Step 2:Move disk 2 from source to auxiliary peg.<br> Step 3:Move disk 1 from destination to auxiliary peg.<br> Step 4:Move disk 3 from source to destination.<br> Step 5:Move disk 1 from auxiliary to source.<br> Step 6:Move disk 2 from auxiliary to destination.<br> Step 7:Move disk 1 from source to destination.<br>"],
