Misuse detection takes a collection of signatures of previous intrusions or known vulnerabilities, and applies it to detect a new occurrence.While accurate, misuse IDSs is often unable to detect variants of known attacks, or attacks that exploit vulnerabilities recently discovered. To get around this problem, an anomaly IDS counts on a characterization of ordinary activity and uses it to distinguish abnormal one.","More often than not, commercial IDSs are bypassed, either by a zero-day attack or by an unseen variant of an existing attack, called a mimicry attack. Then, it is necessary to analyze the vandalized IT system in order to determine how the intruder gained access to it and what he did with it afterward. This analysis usually reveals that, to break into the system, the attacker has run a small program, called an exploit, which has taken advantage of system vulnerability.","<u>Algorithm</u><br>Step 1: Select the number of layers, n, for the completesystem.<br>Step 2: Separately perform features selection for each layer.<br>Step 3: Train a separate model with CRFs for each layerusing the features selected from Step 2.<br>Step 4: Plug in the trained models sequentially such thatonly the connections labeled as normal are passedto the next layer.<br>Step 5: For each (next) test instance perform Steps 6through 9.<br>Step 6: Test the instance and label it either as attack ornormal.<br>Step 7: If the instance is labeled as attack, block it andidentify it as an attack represented by the layername at which it is detected and go to Step 5.

The solution involves moving of the disks one after the other over the pegs obeying the above specified rules. User interface requires the user to enter the number of disks on the source peg. Using the intermediate peg all  the n disks are moved to the destination peg and the number of moves required are 2n -1.","Feature added to this project <br> 1.
